For Python-Challenge Module 3 I was instructed to manually upload my python files from visual studio code to github.
I did so and do not have the results displayed on the individual files so I will include them in the read me.
I am still having issues with githubs keys and recieving access denied in my terminal, I am having these problems configured, but for now this is why I manually uploaded my code.
